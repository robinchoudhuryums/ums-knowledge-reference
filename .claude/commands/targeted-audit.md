Read CLAUDE.md (especially Common Gotchas, Key Design Decisions, and
the Cycle Workflow Config) before starting. Do not make any changes
to any files during this session.

This session's scope: $ARGUMENTS
Use the Subsystems section of CLAUDE.md's Cycle Workflow Config to
identify the relevant files for this subsystem.

[OPTIONAL: PASTE ANY FOLLOW-ON ITEMS FROM A PRIOR SESSION]

[IF TRIGGERED: PASTE ANY POLICY RESPONSE BLOCKS FROM THE LAST HEALTH
SYNTHESIS — these are MANDATORY scope additions for this cycle]

Audit this subsystem thoroughly. For each finding:
- State the issue, cite file and function/line
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Confidence: High / Medium / Low
- Would this bug actually fire in production this month? YES/NO
- Effort to fix: S (< 2 hours) / M (half-day to 2 days) / L (3+ days)

Focus on:
- Bugs and logic errors in currently-reachable code paths
- Security concerns specific to this module
- Inconsistencies between CLAUDE.md and actual implementation
- Cross-module dependencies — what would break in OTHER modules
- Silent degradation paths

DO NOT flag style preferences, speculative improvements, or "could be
cleaner" refactoring unless the current code is actively wrong.

After the audit, produce an implementation plan:
- Action ID (A1, A2, A3...)
- What specifically to do (concrete)
- Which finding(s) it addresses
- Effort: S / M / L
- Cross-module risk: Low / High
- Prerequisites

Organize into:
1. Fix now — production bugs, security issues, blocking problems
2. Fix this session — high-value, well-scoped, low cross-module risk
3. Defer — needs more context, high risk, or dependencies outside scope

End with a TIER 2 HANDOFF BLOCK:

---TIER 2 HANDOFF BLOCK---
Scope: [subsystem]
Findings: [count] total — [critical/high/medium/low breakdown]
Production bugs (would fire this month): [count]

ACTIONS (implement in this order):
[ID] | [File: area] | [Effort] | [Risk] | [Description]

CROSS-MODULE RISKS:
- [what could break outside this scope and where to verify]
(or "None identified")

DO NOT TOUCH:
- [high-risk files/functions — explain why]
