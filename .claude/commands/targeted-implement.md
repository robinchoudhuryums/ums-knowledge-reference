If $ARGUMENTS is empty or missing AND no TIER 2 HANDOFF BLOCK exists
earlier in this session, respond with exactly this and stop:

Usage (same session): /targeted-implement — run after /targeted-audit
Usage (new session): Paste the TIER 2 HANDOFF BLOCK first, then run

---

Read CLAUDE.md (especially Common Gotchas) before starting.

You are implementing the actions from the TIER 2 HANDOFF BLOCK above.

Rules:
- Implement ONLY the actions in the handoff block, in order
- Do not fix anything outside scope — note for follow-on
- Stop on unexpected complexity and describe before continuing
- Stop if touching DO NOT TOUCH files or out-of-scope files
- Check Common Gotchas before each action

After all actions complete:

1. RUN TESTS — classify failures (this session / pre-existing / real bug)
2. REGRESSION CHECK — review each modified file for breakage risk,
   cross-reference CROSS-MODULE RISKS from handoff block
3. REFLECT — for each action: production bug? (YES/NO) New failure
   mode? (YES/NO). Tally net score.
4. INVARIANT CHECK — cross-reference against project invariant library
5. INVARIANT CANDIDATES — new rules from this session's changes
6. SUMMARY — produce TARGETED IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
