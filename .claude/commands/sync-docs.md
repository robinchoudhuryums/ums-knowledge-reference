Four-check documentation drift detection. Do not make changes until
all checks are complete and you've reported findings.

Read CLAUDE.md, README, and any other project documentation before starting.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 1 — CLAUDE.md CURRENCY
═══════════════════════════════════════════

For each section of CLAUDE.md:
- Are known issues listed that have been fixed? (stale gotchas)
- Are there recent changes not reflected in the documentation?
- Do the Key Design Decisions still match the actual implementation?
- Is the Recent Changes section up to date?
- Are file paths and line references still accurate?

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 2 — SUBSYSTEM FILE REFERENCE CURRENCY
═══════════════════════════════════════════

For each subsystem in the Cycle Workflow Config:
- Do all listed files still exist at those paths?
- Are there new files that should be added to a subsystem?
- Have any files been moved, renamed, or deleted?

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 3 — OPERATOR STATE INVENTORY
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Scan for undocumented manual setup requirements:
- Environment variables referenced in code but not in docs
- Configuration files required but not mentioned
- External service dependencies not documented
- Manual migration steps needed but not listed

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 4 — IMPLEMENTATION DRIFT
═══════════════════════════════════════════

For recent implementation changes (last 1-2 cycles):
- Do the changes match what CLAUDE.md says the code does?
- Are there new patterns or conventions introduced that should
  be documented as Key Design Decisions?
- Have any API endpoints changed that aren't reflected in docs?

═══════════════════════════════════════════
REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════

For each check, list findings as:
- [CHECK N] [File: section] — [what's wrong] — [suggested fix]

Organize by priority:
1. Actively misleading (docs say X, code does Y) — fix immediately
2. Missing (undocumented but should be) — add this cycle
3. Stale (no longer relevant) — remove or update

After I review the findings, I will tell you which to implement.
Do not make changes until then.
