Post-implementation test quality assessment and failure resolution.
Leads with coverage and quality analysis, not just failure fixing.

Read CLAUDE.md's Cycle Workflow Config for the test command before starting.

Step 1: RUN TESTS AND CLASSIFY FAILURES

Run the test suite. For each failure, classify into one of 5 categories:
- Category A: Outdated assertions — test expectations that no longer
  match the (correct) new behavior. Fix by updating the assertion.
- Category B: Tests with local redefinitions — tests that redefine
  constants, configs, or values that should be imported from production
  code. Rewrite to import production values.
- Category C: Pre-existing failures — tests that were already failing
  before this cycle's changes. Fix if scoped to current work, otherwise note.
- Category D: Real production bugs caught by correct tests — the test
  is right, the code is wrong. Flag as follow-on item, do NOT fix here.
- Category E: Infrastructure issues — test runner config, missing
  fixtures, environment problems. Fix.

Step 2: FIX CATEGORIES A, B, C, E in priority order.
Category D items are flagged but not fixed (they need their own audit cycle).

Step 3: COVERAGE GAP ANALYSIS (primary value — runs even if all tests pass)

For every change in the most recent implementation summary:
- Does a test exist that would fail if the change regressed?
- If not, that's a coverage gap.

For each gap:
- Describe what's untested
- Classify as simple (<30 min to write) or complex (>30 min)
- Implement simple ones immediately
- Category D ratio: what percentage of fixes have no regression test?

Step 4: TEST QUALITY CHECK

Flag tests that:
- Pass both before and after a fix — they don't guard against regression
- Assert on mock/stub behavior rather than production behavior
- Have assertions so broad they'd pass regardless of the code under test

For each quality issue:
- Is the test salvageable (tighten assertion) or should it be rewritten?
- If salvageable, fix it now

Step 5: CI CONFIGURATION CHECK

Verify:
- TypeScript type-check passes (tsc --noEmit)
- Linter passes with no errors
- Build succeeds
- Coverage thresholds are still met

Report:
- Tests fixed: [count by category]
- Coverage gaps found: [count] — filled: [count] — remaining: [count]
- Quality issues found: [count] — fixed: [count]
- CI status: [all passing / issues found]
